# Bebop2-Animal-Tracking
Code for a Parrot Bebop 2 drone to track animals (will be verified using dogs) steered autonomously from a computer using computer vision.
		
# Draft outline

Aim: Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision to create and autonomous surveillance drone (will be verified using dogs)
Idea: The website would be linked (specific dialog references) to a jupypter notebook aka. tutorials
Remark: We also tried to build our own CNN

# Introduction & Theory
	* General backround: anti-poaching, animal surveillance
	* Aims and goals
	* A.I: Convolutional Neural Network : 
		-brief intro
		-how are we using it 
		-ADD DIAGRAM
	*Interfaces: Computer vision & motion 
		-computer vision & coordinates in space 
		-drone reaction: specific motion according to CNN results
# Materials and methods 
	*Data acquisition and processing

	*Python & Keras/Tensorflow
	*Objection detection software by tensorflow
	*How to build a CNN 
	*How to train the CNN
	*Drone Hardware 
	*Drone software: link to installation guide
# Results
	*Video of the CNN output: loss decrease
	*Video of object recognition
	*Video of the motion drone following a person
		
# Discussion 
	*Technical problems in the context of the animal surveillance
		-flying into trees
		-drone autonomy
		-limited resources
	*Optimisation
		-two other keras backengines 
		-flight path
		-;ultiple threading
		
# Conclusion & Future Ideas 
	*provide more operating systems compatibility
	*thermovision
	*lack of guaranty taht the action send is actually performed (sensors)
